<!-- Please note that this project is currently under development. -->

ðŸš§ This is a *placeholder* for the energypal package. The goal of the
project is to assemble a curated collection of color palettes tailored
for energy-related visualizations, ready to use with ggplot2 and other
plotting frameworks. The palettes are inspired by â€” and occasionally
shamelessly pirated from â€” publicly available visualizations used in
major energy modeling projects and reports, with the goal of returning
them to the public domain and promoting clarity, consistency, and visual
appeal in energy system research and communication.

## Installation

ðŸš§ Not yet available. The first public version of energypal will be
available from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("optimal2050/energypal")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(energypal)
## basic example code
```
